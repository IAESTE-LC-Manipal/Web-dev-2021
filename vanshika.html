        	<i>About me:</i>
        </p>
        </CENTER>
        <p>A freshman pursuing B.Tech in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, I am intrigued by the usage of sustainable energy consumption and I aim to put my knowledge to use for the same in the near future. I am also a passionate speaker, artist and basketball player. I advocate actively for sustaianble consumption currently at the community level but hope to upgrade gradually. I believe in the need to combine technology and  various energy resources to accelerate the sustainable development of the world. That being said, I believe it is essential to tailor these resources for better integration into diverse contexts. Brought up in a strongly opinionated family, I carry within myself an ability to appreciate and grasp conflicting viewpoints. I anticipate opportunities to combine my artistic and scientific interests into social-action centred trajectories. </p>
