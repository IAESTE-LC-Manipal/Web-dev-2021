<h1> Task 1 </h1>

<h4>For your Task 1 we want you to make a portfolio website of your own from scratch. </h4>

At its most basic form, a portfolio website provides professional information about an individual or a company and presents a showcase of their work. 

The following are the subtasks inside this main task: 
<ul>
  <li> Add your image in the portfolio. </li>
  <li> Use basic styling like bold, italics, underline etc. Feel free to explore. </li>
  <li> Try using the div element for a specific block of text. You’ll be editing the same file for the next task so it’ll make your work easier. Although, if you cannot implement that don’t worry we’ll get there. </li> 
  <li> Provide different colors (while using different types of formats for adding colors) and make your portfolio look as pretty as possible. </li>
  <li> Try adding actual and real content instead of just dummy content so that you can actually use this website later. </li>
  <li> Incorporate everything that was taught in the workshop. </li>
</ul>
