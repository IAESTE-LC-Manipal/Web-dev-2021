          <h2><u>Introduction - KSI</u></h2> <br>
          <p>So, as you might have heard, KSI is a well known YouTuber, rapper, and a boxer. The guy has a flair for chasing his dreams and doesn't settle unless he accomplishes them.</p> <br>
          <div class="utube1"><iframe width="100%" height="220px"  src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qsl0XIDLDBY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>
          <br>
          <p>KSI initially started as a gaming YouTuber in 2009, showing clips of him playing the soccer video game FIFA. He continued to produce gaming videos, although he started to branch out into vlog-style uploads. His channel grew quickly, and he reached three million subscribers by the end of 2013-14. He currently has the 115th most popular channel on YouTube, in terms of subscribers, with 20.5 million.

            His popularity also grew as he and other British entertainers formed the entertainment collective Ultimate Sidemen (it would later just be called Sidemen). He continued to create videos like he used to, but within a group to help each creator expand their online presence. In 2017, KSI announced he left the group but later admitted it was a way to drive up attention, and he never actually left.

            As KSI continued to get more popular, he branched out into a music career, and he has seen a lot of success in the United Kingdom. His debut song "Lamborghini" reached No. 30 on the UK singles chart. His debut EP "Keep Up" went to No. 1 on the UK R&B Albums Chart. He has continued to release music and has even gone on tour to promote his songs. He released a collaborative album with YouTuber Randolph earlier this year titled "New Age."</p>

            <br>
            <p>Now, viewers wait for his new album in 2021. I, personally, have been observing the artist and creator for a long time and have admired his style of work.</p>

            <h2><u>The Sidemen</u></h2><br>
            <p>The Sidemen are a British YouTube group consisting of KSI, Miniminter, Zerkaa, TBJZL, Behzinga, Vikkstar123 and W2S. The group is best known for its various YouTube channels, which have a combined total of around 20 million subscribers, as of April 2021.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The group originates from a Rockstar Games Social Club group made on 19 October 2013 in Grand Theft Auto Online, called "The Ultimate Sidemen", which included all the members except for Lewis. In January 2014, Bradley met Lewis while at a FIFA gaming event in New York City and invited him to join the group.[7] Describing the group name, Minter said in a video that "A sideman is basically someone's bitch who just follows them around [...] I was basically JJ's bitch that followed him around."

              In February 2014, KSI, Minter, Bradley, and Barn moved into a house together near London, which they referred to as the "Sidemen House", which allowed them to collaborate more often.

              On 1 December 2020, the group's eponymous YouTube channel surpassed 10 million subscribers. Each member of the group was awarded their own Diamond Play Button by YouTube to mark the milestone.</p>
              <br>
              <p>The group creates fun videos, engaging the audience with hour-long weekly engagement. They now have multiple channels and nothing seems to stop them from being one of the most influential groups on YouTube. personally, my favourite member (as part of the Sidemen) is <i>Miniminter.</i></p>

                <h2><u>Miniminter</u></h2><br>
                <p>So, Miniminter is quite a character. He has a natural sense of humour and engages his audience pretty well. Following is a song that he released - </p><br>

                  <p>Miniminter is a British YouTuber and gamer who is best known for his commentary style videos and vlogs featuring the widely popular game FIFA. With two YouTube channels, Simon has accumulated millions of subscribers and his channel has grown to unprecedented heights.

                    Simon began his journey to internet stardom after posting his first video in 2012. Since then, he has gone on to create hundreds of videos for his subscribers, including challenge videos such as ‚ÄúTry Not To Laugh‚Äù videos and of course, FIFA-related content.

                    Miniminter is a part of the Sidemen group, which sees collaborating with other famous YouTubers including KSI and W2S. As well as regularly uploading videos to his YouTube channel, Simon also live streams on Twitch, playing competitive video games against friends and other creators.

                    One of the highlights of Miniminters career was being the captain of the Sidemen football cup in the charity football match against the YouTube All-stars - an event that will go down in YouTube history.

                    His natural flair of FIFA campaigns and impressive presence on YouTube has seen Simon collaborate with other high profile YouTubers, as well as collaborate with both sports and gaming related brands.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Though Simon is quite impressive, it may be clear from the title that KSI is my favourite :D</p>

                    <h2><u>About YouTube</u></h2> <br>
                    <p>YouTube is an online video platform owned by Google. In total, users watch more than one billion hours of YouTube videos each day, and hundreds of hours of video content are uploaded to YouTube servers every minute.[8]

YouTube provides several ways to watch videos, including the website, the mobile apps, and permitting other websites to embed them. Available content includes music videos, video clips, short and documentary films, audio recordings, movie trailers, live streams, and video blogs. Most content is generated by individuals, but media corporations also publish videos. Besides watching and uploading, registered users can comment on videos, rate them, create playlists, and subscribe to other users.

Founded in 2005, YouTube was acquired the following year by Google for US$1.65 billion. It has become one of the company's most lucrative subsidiaries, earning $19.8 billion in 2020. YouTube and selected creators earn advertising revenue from Google's AdSense program. The vast majority of videos are free to view, but some require a music or premium subscription. </p>
